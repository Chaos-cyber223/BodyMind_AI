# BodyMind_AI 🦾

**Your Personal AI Fat Loss Expert. Say goodbye to ineffective efforts and achieve scientific precision in weight loss.**

---

## 📖 Project Vision

Weight loss is a prolonged battle for modern people. We often find ourselves trapped in endless trending methods like "keto diets," "juice cleanses," and "sauna suits," only to face plateaus, weight rebound, or even health damage. The root cause? We're fighting against a powerful enemy—pseudo-science fueled by commercial hype and blind efforts that don't suit our individual needs.

`BodyMind_AI` was born to end this chaotic war. We firmly believe that **the only sustainable fat loss path comes from understanding science and respecting individual differences.**

Our core mission is to become your most trusted AI fat loss expert:

1. **Science Only**: Our knowledge base exclusively contains authoritative papers and research from top global scientific platforms (like PubMed) on **metabolism, nutrition science, and exercise science**. We arm every fat loss decision with hardcore scientific evidence.

2. **Ultimate Personalization**: Your body is unique. Based on your age, height, weight, body fat percentage, lifestyle, and fat loss goals, we use AI Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and create **precise meal plans down to macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat)** and **the most efficient fat-burning workout combinations**.

3. **Solve Every Challenge**: "What to do when hitting a plateau?", "How to arrange strength and cardio for fastest fat loss?", "Is 16:8 intermittent fasting really right for me?"... Ask the AI anytime and get reliable answers with scientific sources that solve your specific current problems.

`BodyMind_AI` isn't just another fitness app—it's your dedicated fat loss strategist, helping you bypass all detours and reach your goals directly.

## ✨ Core Features

* **🧬 Personalized Fat Loss Plans**: Input your personal data, and AI will generate weekly diet and training plans centered on "creating a caloric deficit."
* **📚 Expert-Level Fat Loss Q&A (RAG)**: Get precise answers based on scientific literature for any specific questions during your fat loss journey.
* **🕸️ Cutting-Edge Knowledge Dynamic Updates (Web Crawler)**: Background crawler system regularly fetches the latest fat loss research, ensuring your plans are always based on the most current science.
* **👤 Fat Loss Profile Management**: Record your weight changes, diet, and training logs, allowing AI to continuously optimize your plan.
