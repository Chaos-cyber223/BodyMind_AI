# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BodyMind_AI is a full-stack AI-powered fat loss expert application combining React Native mobile frontend, Python AI services, and Java Spring Boot backend services in a microservices architecture. The project aims to provide science-based, personalized fat loss guidance through AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

## Development Commands

### Mobile Development (React Native + Expo)
```bash
# Start mobile development
cd mobile && npm run web                # Web development at http://localhost:19006
cd mobile && npm start                  # Expo development server
cd mobile && npm run android            # Android emulator
cd mobile && npm run ios                # iOS simulator

# Root-level mobile commands
npm run dev:mobile                      # From project root
```

### Backend Services

#### AI Service (Python FastAPI) - ✅ READY
```bash
# Setup AI service environment
cd backend/ai-service
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add OPENAI_API_KEY if available

# Start AI service
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# API docs available at: http://localhost:8000/docs

# From project root (future)
npm run dev:ai
```

#### API Service (Java Spring Boot) - ⏳ PLANNED
```bash
cd backend/api-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
npm run dev:api                         # From project root

# Start all services simultaneously (when Java service is ready)
npm run dev                             # Runs mobile, AI service, and API service concurrently
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# Full stack with Docker
docker-compose up -d                    # Start all services
docker-compose down                     # Stop all services
npm run docker:up                       # Shorthand for docker-compose up
npm run docker:down                     # Shorthand for docker-compose down
```

### Build Commands
```bash
npm run build                           # Build all services
npm run build:mobile                    # Expo web build
npm run build:ai                        # Docker image for AI service
npm run build:api                       # Maven package for API service
```

### Testing and Quality
```bash
npm run test                            # Run all tests
npm run test:mobile                     # React Native tests
npm run test:ai                         # Python pytest
npm run test:api                        # Java Maven tests

npm run lint                            # Lint all services
npm run lint:mobile                     # Expo lint
npm run lint:ai                         # Python pylint

# Cleanup
npm run clean                           # Clean all services
```
